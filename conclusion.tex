\section{Conclusion}

We conclude that the \hoeffdingtree, the \mondrianforest, and the
\naivebayes data stream classifiers have an overall superiority over the
\FNN and the \mcnns ones for \har.  However, the prediction performance
remains quite low compared to an offline \knn classifier, and it varies
substantially between datasets. Noticeably, the \hoeffdingtree and the
\mcnns classifiers are more resilient to concept drift that the other ones.

Regarding memory consumption, only the \mcnn and \naivebayes classifiers
were found to have a negligible memory footprint, in the order of a few
kilobytes, which is compatible with connected objects. Conversely, the
memory consumed by a \mondrianforest, a \FNN or a \hoeffdingtree is in the
order of 100~kB, which would only be available on some connected objects.
In addition, the classification performance of a \mondrianforest is
strongly modulated by the amount of memory allocated. With enough memory, a
\mondrianforest is likely to match or exceed the performance of the
\hoeffdingtree and \naivebayes classifiers.

The amount of energy consumed by classifiers is mostly impacted by their
runtime, as all power consumptions were found comparable. The
\hoeffdingtree and \mondrianforest are substantially slower than the other
classifiers, with runtimes in the order of 0.35~ms/element, a performance not compatible 
with common sampling frequencies of wearable sensors. 


\revision{
In this work, we found that the tree-based classifiers were not design with
memory constraint in mind. 
Even though data stream classifiers were designed to minimize the memory
footprint, they were not designed to work with a given memory budget. For
instance, a device with one megabyte of main

Par example, supposon une
platform qui n'ai qu'un mega de RAM, il n'y a aucun garanti de fonctionnement
pour HT or Mondrian. Dans le future, on va dev des algo capable de prévoir et de
fonctionner avec une peak memory consumption. En particulier, nous prévoyons
d'étudier l'échantillonage et la selection d'arbre selon des critère de conso
émmoire et de performance de classification.
In addition deploying classification algorithm on actual connected object might
highligjt other relevant research direction.
